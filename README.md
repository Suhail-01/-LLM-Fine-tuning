# ðŸ§  Large Language Model (LLM) Fine-tuning

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your specific dataset and tasks, making it more effective for your needs.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The project uses the `GPT-2` model (or any other LLM of your choice) and fine-tunes it on a custom dataset. The resulting model can generate text in the style of your dataset and is ideal for tasks like content creation, dialogue systems, or any other NLP application.
